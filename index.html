					<h3>A Few Accomplishments</h3>
					<p>Some of the project I worked on during my academic career at the University of Minnesota or
						earlier</p>
					<div class="features">

							<a style="pointer-events: none; cursor: default;" href="#" class="image"><img

							<div class="inner" id="drone">
								<h4>Drone Simulation</h4>
								<p>Developed in the course of Program Design & Development in a group of 4, this project
									is coded in C++ with a combination of HTML and Javascript to perform a simulation of
									a delivery system with drones.</p>

							</div>
						</article>
						<h5>Entities</h5>
						<p>This simulation consists of 3 different entities, Drone, Package and Customer, each
							package is assigned to a customer. The idea is that multiple information of entities are
							loaded in as a SQL file, created with a composite factory pattern, then the drones will
							calculate the path to the closest package and traverse to pick up the package and
							deliver to the customer.</p>
						<h5>Activity Logs</h5>
						<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/observe.png" alt="" /></span>While the entities
							are moving to perform their assigned task, their activities are also recorded using the
							Observer pattern, which also acts as a notification in the system to manage the delivery
							status.<br>
							<br><br>
							<br><br>
						</p>
						<h5>Battery Tracking</h5>
						<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/batt.jpg" alt="" /></span>Each drone has a
							certain amount of battery charge that dissipates while moving. When the battery charge
							goes to 0, the drone will stop moving and drop the package at its location. Then the
							closest live drone will come by to pick up the dropped package to finish the task. Using
							the Decorator pattern, we are able to color code the amount of battery charge of each
							drone during the simulation.

						</p>
						<h5>Paths</h5>
						<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/para.jpg" alt="" /></span>The drones can have
							different movements based on what is assigned in the SQL file, the Beeline, Parabolic and
							Smart. The Beeline path makes the drone rise to a set altitude while moving 45 degree
							upwards, move in a straight line towards the package and descend at a 45 degree angle when
							it reaches the destination. Parabolic path makes the drone rise and move towards the
							destination in a parabola. The smart path uses A* search algorithm to find the path to get
							to the destination on the simulated map.</p>

							<div class="inner" id="spectrogram">
								<h4>Spectrogram</h4>
								<p>Spectrogram is a visualization of signal strength over time at different frequencies
									in a waveform. In the course of Natural Language Processing, I used python to create
									a Spectrogram of wav files from the TIMIT corpus.
									This process includes reading the signals in binary, translating the signals to
									integers and applying a hamming window function then using fourier transform to find
									strengths in each signal. Finally convert the data into a relative grayscale to
									create an Spectrogram image of that particular audio file.

								greasy wash
								water all year."</figcaption>

							<a style="pointer-events: none; cursor: default;" href="#" class="image"><img
									src="images/er.jpg" alt="" /></a>
							<div class="inner" id="data">
								<h4>Database design</h4>
								<p>With a group of 4 in the Course of Database Systems, we designed a database for a
									hypothetical clinic. With a list of conditions, we first draw out the ER diagram for
									the system, then mapping its relations. Lastly, we implemented them into a SQL
									database and tested them with SQL queries.</p>

							<a style="pointer-events: none; cursor: default;" href="#" class="image"><img
									src="images/cyk.jpg" alt="" /></a>
							<div class="inner" id="cyk">
								<h4>CYK Parser with Context Free Grammar</h4>
								<p>In the Natural Language Processing course, I made a program with python to distinguish a
									sentence's "meaning" using Cocke–Younger–Kasami(CYK, or CKY) algorithm, which is a
									parsing algorithm for context free grammar(CFG). This algorithm is able to take a
									sentence, determine if it is valid for the given CFG, or parse all possible
									derivations of the sentence based on the CFG.</p>

									src="images/sort.jpg" alt="" /></a>
							<div class="inner" id="ios">
								<h4>Inventory tracking app in iOS</h4>
								<p>During a course of Mobile App Development in high school, I created an iOS
									application designed specifically for tracking art supplies in a classroom setting.
									The idea is for students to be able to borrow supplies from an automatic system that
									keeps a log on who, when and how many items did the students borrow, and notify the
									teacher when items need to be returned by the students. </p>
